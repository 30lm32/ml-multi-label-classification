If you want to see the further ML projects, you may visit my main repo: https://github.com/erdiolmezogullari/ml-projects

Dataset was collected over different fashion web sites. It consists of 7 fields like below.

* `id`: A unique product identifier
* `name`: The title of the product, as displayed on our website
* `description`: The description of the product
* `price`: The price of the product
* `shop`: The shop from which you can buy this product
* `brand`: The product brand
* `labels`: The category labels that apply to this product

The text features (name, description) are in different languages, such as English, German and Russian. The format of target feature is multilabels (60 categories) that were tagged according to corresponding to the category in fashion web sites differently.
